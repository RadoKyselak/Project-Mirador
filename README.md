# Stelthar API
Stelthar provides real-time, governemnt-backed data fact-checking for a better, more transparent version of the internet.

Disinformation erodes public trust, and traditional fact-checking is slow. Stelthar's fact-checking verifies or argues claims by comparing claim validity against official government data sources.

Highlight any text, and our browser extension provides an evidence-based verdict, a confidence score, and links to the primary sources. This reduces verification time from hours to seconds, empowering users to challenge misinformation with auditable proof.
