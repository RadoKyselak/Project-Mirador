# Project Mirador
This repository is the codebase for **Project Mirador** and the **Stelthar API.** 

Project Mirador provides real-time, government-backed data fact-checking for a better, more transparent version of the internet.

Disinformation erodes public trust, and traditional fact-checking is slow, inriliable, or both. Stelthar's fact-checking API verifies or argues claims by comparing claim validity against official government data sources.

Highlight any text, and our browser extension provides an evidence-based verdict, a confidence score, and links to the primary sources. This reduces verification time from hours to seconds, empowering users to challenge misinformation with auditable proof.

Key Features
----------
- Real-time claim verification against official government data sources
- Evidence-based verdicts: Supported, Contradicted, or Inconclusive
- Confidence scoring that reflects data coverage and match quality
- Direct links to the primary sources used for verification
- Browser extension integration for on-page highlight-and-check functionality
- API-first design for easy integration into apps, dashboards, and extensions

Tech stack
----------
- Backend: Python
- Frontend: JavaScript + HTML + CSS
- APIs:
  - Data: Data.gov, BLS, BEA, Congress, Census Bureau
  - Intelligence: Gemini (restrained)
- Dev: VSCode (IDE), Vercel (API hosting), Postman (API testing)

**Disclaimer**
----------

Project Mirador uses publicly available U.S. Government open data sources but is not affiliated with or endorsed by any governmental agency.
Verdicts and confidence scores are algorithmic estimates — they assist, not replace, human judgment.
